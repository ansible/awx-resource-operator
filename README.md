An operator that can be used along side [Ansible AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx) to launch automation jobs and create job templates by creating resources directly in kubernetes. This operator is built with [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) and Ansible.

## Overview

There are currently two Custom Resources provided by the awx-resource-operator:

* AnsibleJob - launches a job in the AWX instance specified in the the specified k8s secret (awx host url, token)
* JobTemplate - creates a job template in the AWX instance specified.

### Prerequisites

* Install the kubernetes-based cluster of your choice:
  * [Openshift](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/installing/index.html)
  * [K8s](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
  * [CodeReady containers](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_local/2.5)
  * [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
* Deploy AWX using the [awx-operator](https://github.com/ansible/awx-operator#basic-install)
* Create an OAuth2 token for your user in the AWX UI


## Installing the Operator

1. Clone the awx-resource-operator

```
git clone git@github.com:ansible/awx-resource-operator.git
```

2. Log in to your cluster.

```
kubectl login <cluster-url>
```

3. Run the make target

```
NAMESPACE=awx IMG=quay.io/ansible/awx-resource-operator:latest make deploy
```

This will create a deployment named `resource-operator-controller-manager` in the namespace specified, in this case the `awx` namespace. The resulting operator pod will reconcile any AnsibleJob or JotTemplate resources created.


## Usage

Now that the awx-resource-operator is installed in your cluster, you can try creating a k8s resource to manage your AWX instance.

First, you need create a k8s secret with connection information for your AWX instance though. Below is example yaml that you can save to a file, edit, and apply to your cluster.

### Create an AWX Access Token

Create an OAuth2 token for your user in the AWX UI.

1. Navigate to Users
2. Select the username you wish to create a token for
3. Click on tokens, then the green plus icon
4. Application can be left empty, input a description and select the read/write scope.

> Alternatively, you can create one at the command-line using the `create_oauth2_token` manage command ([docs](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/tower-manage.html#create-oauth2-token))

### Create a Connection Secret

To make this connection information available to the operator, create a k8s secret with the host and token value. Here is example yaml for the connection k8s secret.

```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: awx-access
  type: Opaque
stringData:
  token: <generated-token>
  host: https://my-awx-host.example.com/
```

Save this to a file, for example, `awx-connection-secret.yml`, edit it with your host and token value, the apply it to your cluster.

```
kubectl create -f awx-connection-secret.yml
```

### AnsibleJob

Launch an automation job on AWX by creating an AnsibleJob resource. Be sure to specify the connection secret on `connection_secret` as well as the Job Template you wish to launch.

```
---
apiVersion: tower.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: AnsibleJob
metadata:
  generateName: demo-job-1 # generate a unique suffix per 'kubectl create'
spec:
  connection_secret: awx-access
  job_template_name: Demo Job Template
```

It is possible to configure other things like inventory, extra vars, and time to live for the job.

```
spec:
  connection_secret: awx-access
  job_template_name: Demo Job Template
  inventory: Demo Inventory                    # Inventory prompt on launch needs to be enabled
  runner_image: quay.io/ansible/awx-resource-runner
  runner_version: latest
  job_ttl: 100

  extra_vars:                                  # Extra variables prompt on launch needs to be enabled
     test_var: test

  job_tags: "provision,install,configuration"  # Specify tags to run
  skip_tags: "configuration,restart"           # Skip tasks with a given tag
```

Note that prompt on launch needs to be enabled for inventories and extra vars if you are specifying those. In order to enable "PROMPT ON LAUNCH", within the AWX UI:

1. Select Resources -> Templates
2. Within Templates, select your template and click the "PROMPT ON LAUNCH" checkbox next to INVENTORY and EXTRA VARIABLES.

#### Launching Workflows

Launch a Workflow Job Template with an AnsibleJob object by specifying the `workflow_template_name` instead of `job_template_name`.

```
---
apiVersion: tower.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: AnsibleJob
metadata:
  generateName: demo-job-1 # generate a unique suffix per 'kubectl create'
spec:
  connection_secret: awx-access
  name: Demo Workflow Template
```

### JobTemplate

Create a job template on AWX by creating a JobTemplate resource.

```
---
apiVersion: tower.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: JobTemplate
metadata:
  name: jobtemplate-4
spec:
  connection_secret: awx-access
  name: ExampleJobTemplate4
  project: Demo Project
  playbook: hello_world.yml
  inventory: Demo Inventory
```


## Building and Testing

If you have made changes to the operator and want to test them, you can do the following:

Build the operator image

```
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<your-registry>:dev
```

Deploy the operator

```
make deploy NAMESPACE=awx IMG=<your-registry>:dev
```
